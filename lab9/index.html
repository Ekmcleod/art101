					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> One of the problems we faced was that our buttons were not working correctly. 
                        We found that it was because we were not labeling our index.html sections correctly to match the jQuery labels. </p>

			<div class="minor-section" id="results">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Doing this lab helped us better understand the importance of labeling our functions correctly. 
                        Most of the time our errors stem from mislabelled functions. 
                   </p>
