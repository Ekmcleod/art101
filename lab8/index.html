			<h1>Lab 8: Anon functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> To work with a partner and experiment with different types of functions and callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> One of the problems we faced, was making the new function and understanding the variables. 
                        We had to use ChatGPT to help us create the function. We went over line by line to understand what the function was doing. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Doing this lab helped us better understand the form of a function. We were also able to do the bonus task, 
                        however, we weren't sure how to show the original array displayed on the website. We look forward to learning more abot jQuery!
