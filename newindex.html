        <p> Hi, my name is Ekaterina and I am a 4th year studying Business Management Economics. 
            I have always loved playing video games, my favorite being World of Warcraft. I have also always been athletic, so I enjoy going on hikes and going to the gym.
            Right now, I'm looking for jobs in the Santa Cruz area <br>
