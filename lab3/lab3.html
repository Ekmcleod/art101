        <h1> Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
        <p> The purpose of the lab was to become familiar with file structures and to 
            add other html files from the computer onto our website
        </p>
        <h2> Challenges</h2>
        <p> We initally had a hard time creating a new file in the art101 folder. The new File we created
            ended up in a different folder called 'experiments' and since it was in that folder
            we could not get our images to upload.
        </p>
        <h3> Results </h3>
        <p> The results of our efforts provided a web page containng hyperlinks to our other lab assignments. 
            In addition to this our website now contains a face to the coders.   </p>
