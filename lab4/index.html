			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of the lab is to play around with pseudocode and see how it can help solve coing issues.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the problems that we faced was trying to psedocode a game of pinball. 
					We tried to keep it as simple as possible. We also had to research some ways that coders would code certain functions, such as scores.
				To solve these problems we looked over pseduocode from other programmers and tried to mimic their methods.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We had fun working on a list of steps for the first task, as we had to ensure that we weren't missing any crucial parts.
						For the simple game of pinball, it was a bit more challenging for us, as neither of us have coded a game before.
						This was why we needed to do additioonal research, which was a little tedious. But it was neat to think about how even a simple game
						can require a lot of functions. It definently made us appreciate the more complex games that we play today!

					<pre><code> 
						Pseudocode for coffee in a french-press 

						1. Gather ingredients and equipment: get coffee beans, a French press, a grinder, a kettle, water, and a spoon.

						2. Fill the kettle with the desired amount of water for brewing.

						3. Measure the appropriate amount of coffee beans based on your preference and the size of your French press.

						4. Grind the coffee beans to a coarse consistency.

						5. Pour hot water into the French press to preheat it. Let it sit for a few seconds, then discard the water.

						6. Place the ground coffee into the preheated French press.

						7. Pour hot (but not boiling) water over the coffee grounds in the French press.

						8. Stir the coffee grounds and water gently with a spoon to ensure even saturation.

						9. Place the lid on the French press with the plunger pulled up.

						10. Let the coffee steep for about 4 minutes to extract flavor.

						11. After steeping, slowly press down the plunger of the French press to separate the grounds from the brewed coffee.

						12. Pour the brewed coffee into your mug or a serving carafe immediately to prevent over-extraction.

						13. Serve and enjoy your coffee!

						
						Pseudeocode for Pinball game
							//Set up the game environment
					  //- Create the playfield with obstacles, flippers, bumpers, and targets.
					  //- Initialize game variables like score and lives.
					
					//2. Launch the ball
					  //- Display a plunger for the player to pull or press to launch the ball onto the playfield.
					
					// 3. Ball movement and collision detection
					  //- Implement physics for the ball's movement (gravity, bounce, friction).
					  //- Detects collisions with flippers, bumpers, walls, and targets.
					
					//4. Score and game progression
					  //- Increase the score based on interactions with bumpers, targets, and other elements.
					  //- Track the number of balls remaining (lives).
					  //- Implement bonuses or extra balls for achieving certain goals.
					
					//5. End of game
					  //- Decrease lives when the ball falls through the bottom of the playfield.
					  //- Check for game-over conditions (no lives left).
					  //- Allow the player to restart the game or exit.
