//Set up the game environment
  //- Create the playfield with obstacles, flippers, bumpers, and targets.
  //- Initialize game variables like score and lives.

//2. Launch the ball
  //- Display a plunger for the player to pull or press to launch the ball onto the playfield.

// 3. Ball movement and collision detection
  //- Implement physics for the ball's movement (gravity, bounce, friction).
  //- Detects collisions with flippers, bumpers, walls, and targets.

//4. Score and game progression
  //- Increase the score based on interactions with bumpers, targets, and other elements.
  //- Track the number of balls remaining (lives).
  //- Implement bonuses or extra balls for achieving certain goals.

//5. End of game
  //- Decrease lives when the ball falls through the bottom of the playfield.
  //- Check for game-over conditions (no lives left).
  //- Allow the player to restart the game or exit.
