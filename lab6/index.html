			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To practice with arrays and other basic types of variables.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We were having issues with the syntax of the declaring objects. 
						When we were creating the object, we forgot to include commas at the end 
						of each line of data. We were a bit stuck on why the code wasn't running properly, 
						so we turned to Chat Gpt to help solve our coding errors. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We liked how straight-forward this lab was, much like lab 5. We did hit more syntax errors
					   this time around, but it was satisfying to correct them. It was funny to us, how
					a comma can have a huge effect on whether the code runs or not. </p>
